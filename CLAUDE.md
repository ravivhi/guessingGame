# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Guessing Game** is a Hebrew-language PWA implementation of a word-guessing party game. Deployed at `ravivh.com` via GitHub Pages. The entire app — markup, styles, logic, and 700+ word dictionary — lives in a single `index.html` file with no build pipeline.

## Development

No build step, no package manager, no dependencies. To develop:
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it with any static file server (e.g., `python -m http.server`)
- Deploy by pushing to `main` — GitHub Pages auto-publishes

## Architecture

**Single file: `index.html`**

The file has three logical sections:
1. **CSS** (~lines 18–226): Purple gradient theme, mobile-first responsive (breakpoint at 480px), RTL Hebrew support
2. **HTML** (~lines 228–300): Five named screens that are shown/hidden via JS — `setup-screen`, `start-screen`, `game-screen`, `summary-screen`, `names-screen`
3. **JavaScript** (~lines 302–1113): All game logic

### Key data structures

```js
// Global tournament state, persisted to localStorage as 'aliasTournamentData'
tournamentData = {
  player1: {
    name: "שחקן 1",
    totalScore: 0,
    roundsPlayed: 0,
    wordPool: [...],   // words allocated to this player
    playedWords: []    // words already used this session
  }
}
```

`masterWordsBank` is a flat array of 722 Hebrew words defined in JS. On tournament start, words are divided evenly across players — each player gets their own isolated pool.

### Screen flow

```
setup-screen → start-screen ↔ game-screen → summary-screen → start-screen
                    ↕
               names-screen
```

### Core functions

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `initTournament()` | Load saved state from localStorage or show setup |
| `startTournament()` | Partition `masterWordsBank` among N players |
| `startGame(playerKey)` | Begin a 60-second round for the selected player |
| `handleAnswer(isCorrect)` | Score the current word (+1 / -1), advance to next |
| `endRound()` | Persist scores, show summary screen |
| `saveToStorage()` | Serialize `tournamentData` to localStorage |

### PWA details

Service Worker and Web App Manifest are both inline (as `<script>` and data URI). The app is fully offline-capable after first load. localStorage key `aliasDataVersion` guards schema migrations.

## Conventions

- Hebrew UI text throughout; keep new strings in Hebrew
- No frameworks — stay vanilla JS/CSS
- Screen visibility is controlled by toggling a `hidden` CSS class or `display` style directly on the screen `<div>` elements
- The 60-second game timer is managed with `setInterval`; always clear it (`clearInterval(gameTimer)`) before starting a new round
